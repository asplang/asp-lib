Asp libraries change log
========================

The following is a history of changes to the Asp libraries software, in reverse
chronological order.

Changes
-------

Version 0.5.0.0: (codec -> 0.2.2.0, crc -> 0.2.0.0, string -> 0.1.1.0)
- codec and string libraries:
  - Added a prefixes to the C implementation function names to ensure they are
    unique within the application.
- crc library:
  - Changed the names of the script-callable functions to remove the "crc_"
    prefix, assuming application developers will import the specification
    rather than including it. The old specification with the "crc_" prefixes is
    still available as crc-prefixed.asps.

Version 0.4.0.0: (string -> 0.1.0.0)
- Added a string library that includes:
  - String character classification functions.
  - Functions modeled on Python's string methods.
- Added a top-level test project that imports all library modules.

Version 0.3.0.2: (crc -> 0.1.1.1)
- Added more strict compile diagnostics when using the GNU toolset.
- Made some minor fixes to the crc library to avoid warnings.

Version 0.3.0.1:
- Added a "-d" suffix to the file names of debug versions of the libraries and
  test executables.

Version 0.3.0.0 (sort -> 0.1.0.0):
- Added a sort library with sort and sorted functions.
  - Note that this library requires Asp version 1.2.3.0 (i.e., Asp engine
    version 1.2.2.0) or later.
- Added some common testing infrastructure, using it to build a test driver
  for the sort library.
- Separated top-level version and versions of individual libraries out of the
  CMakeLists.txt files into separate text files where they can be maintained
  independently from the build specs.

Version 0.2.1.0 (codec -> 0.2.1.0, crc -> 0.1.1.0):
- Made code involving calls to AspCount resilient to whatever version of Asp
  is installed. The signature of AspCount changed in version 1.1.

Version 0.2.0.0 (codec -> 0.2.0.0):
- codec library:
  - Added encode_str and decode_str routines for string fields.
  - Added unsigned 8- and 16-bit encoding routines.
  - Added range checking to all numeric encoding routines.

Version 0.1.0.1:
- Restructured build options and added CMake install components.

Version 0.1.0.0:
- Initial release, with the following libraries: codec, crc.
