# Libraries for the Asp scripting platform

This repository contains a collection of libraries and function specification
files that may be included in the top-level function specification file for an
application that uses the Asp scripting platform. It also includes pure Asp
routines where a C implementation is not needed. Such modules may simply be
imported. If using installed libraries, make sure ${PREFIX}/include/asp-lib is
in the ASP_INCLUDE environment variable, where PREFIX is e.g., /usr or
/usr/local, etc.
